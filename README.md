# Plucking a Guitar String (Guitar Hero)

This repository contains a Java implementation of the "Plucking a Guitar String" assignment, commonly known as Guitar Hero. The project focuses on creating three classes: "RingBuffer," "GuitarString," and "GuitarHero," as outlined in the lab instructions. This assignment is designed for individual work.

## Getting Started

1. **Required Structure:**
   - Create a Java project.
   - Implement the following classes with the specified names and signatures:
     - "RingBuffer"
     - "GuitarString"
     - "GuitarHero"

2. **Project Structure:**
   - Create a "documents" folder in "Project6" to house a `readme.txt` file.
   - Create a "lib" folder in "Project6," place `stdlib.jar` into it, and add it to the project's build path.

3. **Internal Design (RingBuffer):**
   - Instead of a provided template, design the `RingBuffer` class from scratch. Consider using an internal design that tracks the first and the size rather than the first and last, for simplicity and accuracy, especially in empty or full buffer scenarios.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the `RingBuffer` and `GuitarString` classes in isolation. You can achieve this by incorporating a main method for testing in each class. Alternatively, you may use JUnit if you are familiar with it or are willing to explore it.

     
## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Project6.git
   ```

2. **Open in Eclipse:**
   - Import the cloned project into Eclipse.

3. **Follow Specific Tasks:**
   - Test the classes in isolation, either with a main method or using JUnit.

4. **Run and Validate:**
   - Run the `GuitarHero` class and validate that the program functions correctly.

## Additional Notes

- This project is an individual assignment.
- The specified internal design for the `RingBuffer` class is recommended for simplicity and accuracy.
- Ensure the classes adhere to the API specifications provided in the lab instructions.
